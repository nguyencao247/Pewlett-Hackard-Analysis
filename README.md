## Summary: 
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
According to retiring_titles.csv above, Pewlett Hackard needs to fill  at least 90,398 positions when employees start to retire, the most being Senior Engineers (33% of the retirees).

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
There are 240,124 total Pwelett Hackard employees. Out of that, 90,398 are retiring (which is 38% of their entire workforce). According to [mentorship_eligibilty.csv](https://github.com/nguyencao247/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/Data/mentorship_eligibilty.csv), there are only 1,549 employees that are eligible to be mentors. If the organization were to replace all of their retirees, each mentor would have about 59 mentees! Thatâ€™s way too many mentees. Pewlette Hackard should be more prepared for this large number of upcoming retirees.
